# express-advanced-router

This module provides a robust file-based routing solution for Express.js applications. It supports a wide range of routing methods, including public and catch-all routes, with various syntax options for flexible and comprehensive route management.

You can define route types (Dynamic, Static, Catch-All, Public) by using specific syntax structures within folder names. The same flexibility applies to methods within routes. This approach helps you avoid complexity and provides a more efficient and advanced routing system.

# How to use

To use this application, first create an Express application. Pass the application as a parameter to the module exported as the default from "express-advanced-router". If a RouteOptions object is not provided, it will search for the routes folder in "src/routes". If the folder is not found, an error will be thrown.

```js
import express from "express";
import advancedRouter from "./index";

const app = express();

await advancedRouter(app);

app.listen(3000);
```

## Route Options

You can use customizable settings to change the location of the routes folder, the base route (e.g., baseRoute), or the public route name. To do this, create a RouteOptions object and pass it as a parameter after your expressApp.

# Route Types & Prefixes

When defining route types, specific naming conventions should be followed. These conventions are straightforward and easy to understand. For static routes, no special syntax is requiredâ€”simply name the route as needed.

| Route Type     | Description                                                                                 | RegExp                |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| **`PUBLIC`**   | The public route should be placed in the root directory of the `routes` folder. It must be a directory and should be named `_public`. | `/^_public$/i`        |
| **`STATIC`**   | For static routes, simply name the file as the desired route.                                |                       |
| **`DYNAMIC`**  | To define a dynamic route, append `[[]]` to the folder name and place the parameter name between `[[` and `]]`. | `/^\[\[[0-9a-zA-Z]+\]\]/` |
| **`CATCH_ALL`**| To define a catch-all route, simply prefix the folder name with `$`.                         | `/^\$/`               |

## Route Ordering
Routes are ordered based on their type, not by file order. This approach helps prevent inconsistencies and errors. 
 - The order of precedence is as follows: Public > Static > Dynamic > Catch-All.

# Route Handlers
To define handlers within a route, you should name the file using the handler method's name. This allows you to specify the HTTP method that the file will handle. Please note the following conventions: The method name should be written in uppercase and followed by an underscore (_). After that, you can use any naming convention you prefer. For example: GET_index.ts. Both .ts and .js file extensions are supported.

Currently supported methods:

- `GET` = GET_
- `POST` = POST_
- `PUT` = PUT_
- `DELETE` = DELETE_
- `PATCH` = PATCH_
- `OPTIONS` = OPTIONS_
- `HEAD` = HEAD_

# Handler File Structure
In the file structure for handlers, there should be a handler function that is exported as the default, along with an array that contains any middleware. Important points to note: The handler must always be exported as the default, while middleware should be exported as a named export within an array named middlewares.

## Middlewares
Middlewares are similar to handlers in that they also take req, res, and next as parameters. To apply middlewares in a handler, import them into the handler's file. Then, define a middlewares variable as an array of type Handler[]. Place the middlewares you wish to apply in the array in the desired order, and export this array as a named export.

### Example Handler With Middlewares
The handler must always be exported as the default.

```ts
import type { Handler } from "express";
import {mw_1,mw_2} from "../middlewares/index";

export const middlewares: Handler[] = [mw_1, mw_2];

const handler: Handler = async (req, res) => {
  res.sendStatus(200);
};

export default handler;
```
