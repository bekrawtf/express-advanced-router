# express-advanced-router

This module provides a robust file-based routing solution for Express.js applications. It supports a wide range of routing methods, including public and catch-all routes, with various syntax options for flexible and comprehensive route management.

You can define route types (Dynamic, Static, Catch-All, Public) by using specific syntax structures within folder names. The same flexibility applies to methods within routes. This approach helps you avoid complexity and provides a more efficient and advanced routing system.

# How to use

To use this application, first create an Express application. Pass the application as a parameter to the module exported as the default from "express-advanced-router". If a RouteOptions object is not provided, it will search for the routes folder in "src/routes". If the folder is not found, an error will be thrown.

```js
import express from "express";
import advancedRouter from "./index";
import path from "path";

const app = express();

await advancedRouter(app);

app.listen(3000);
```

## Route Options

You can use customizable settings to change the location of the routes folder, the base route (e.g., baseRoute), or the public route name. To do this, create a RouteOptions object and pass it as a parameter after your expressApp.

# Route Types & Prefixes

When defining route types, specific naming conventions should be followed. These conventions are straightforward and easy to understand. For static routes, no special syntax is requiredâ€”simply name the route as needed.

| Route Type     | Description                                                                                 | RegExp                |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| **`PUBLIC`**   | The public route should be placed in the root directory of the `routes` folder. It must be a directory and should be named `_public`. | `/^_public$/i`        |
| **`STATIC`**   | For static routes, simply name the file as the desired route.                                |                       |
| **`DYNAMIC`**  | To define a dynamic route, append `[[]]` to the folder name and place the parameter name between `[[` and `]]`. | `/^\[\[[0-9a-zA-Z]+\]\]/` |
| **`CATCH_ALL`**| To define a catch-all route, simply prefix the folder name with `$`.                         | `/^\$/`               |

## Route Ordering
Routes are ordered based on their type, not by file order. This approach helps prevent inconsistencies and errors. 
 - The order of precedence is as follows: Public > Static > Dynamic > Catch-All.

# Route Handlers
To define handlers within a route, you should name the file using the handler method's name. This allows you to specify the HTTP method that the file will handle. Please note the following conventions: The method name should be written in uppercase and followed by an underscore (_). After that, you can use any naming convention you prefer. For example: GET_index.ts. Both .ts and .js file extensions are supported.

Currently supported methods:

- `GET` = GET_
- `POST` = POST_
- `PUT` = PUT_
- `DELETE` = DELETE_
- `PATCH` = PATCH_
- `OPTIONS` = OPTIONS_
- `HEAD` = HEAD_
